work-view.the-round-table.description.3=Regarding the software architecture, a micro-kernel architecture has been implemented to separate the core application logic from plugins that can be added to extend its functionality. An MVC design pattern has also been used to separate the graphical interface logic, along with several other design patterns that ensure easy scalability and maintainability of the code.
work-view.the-round-table.description.4=Plugin development is simple and flexible. Developers have built-in functionalities to interact with the database, graphical interface, and other plugins easily and efficiently. As an open-source project, the repositories of currently developed plugins are available for exploration to understand how they work and interact.

work-view.the-round-table.state.3.title=Update
work-view.the-round-table.state.3.detail=The project is in continuous development and is updated with each new version. Version 3.0.0 is expected to be released before June, featuring a major new addition: a network protocol that will enable communication between different instances of the software, defining one as the central server. This is a fundamental feature that should have been included in the initial release but, due to time constraints, has only now been implemented.

work-view.cuqdyn-c.features.3=Uncertainty Quantification in Dynamic Models of Biological Systems

work-view.cuqdyn-c.description.1=Cuqdyn-C is a library and CLI for Uncertainty Quantification in Dynamic Models of Biological Systems. This project was developed at CESGA, commissioned by CSIC, with the objective of transpiling Matlab code from a study carried out by CSIC and Harvard University into C for subsequent parallelization and optimization.
work-view.cuqdyn-c.description.2=The project uses C for the application logic, Fortran for the ESS solver responsible for generating possible solutions to the problem given observed states, and Rust for model definitions. In addition, MPI was used within a distributed computing environment to parallelize the application and solve large-scale problems.
work-view.cuqdyn-c.description.3=The original study can be found at the following link: https://zenodo.org/records/13838652

work-view.cuqdyn-c.state.1.title=Development
work-view.cuqdyn-c.state.1.detail=Both the library and the CLI have met their objectives and were delivered to the clients. Nevertheless, further development is not ruled out, such as adding the possibility of using fewer observed states than those defined by the model.

# work view -> DB-sniffer
work-view.db-sniffer.technicaldata.technologies=Rust and different relational databases
work-view.db-sniffer.technicaldata.role=Architect and Developer

work-view.db-sniffer.features.1=Relational databases

work-view.db-sniffer.description.1=DB-Sniffer is a tool for the introspection of relational databases. It allows connecting to different databases and obtaining information about tables, columns, and their relationships, to later export the data obtained to different formats such as Hibernate mapping files.
work-view.db-sniffer.description.2=The application was developed due to the need to generate Hibernate XML mapping files during my time as a student, since this form of mapping is obsolete and I was unable to find an available tool to do it easily.

work-view.db-sniffer.state.1.title=Development
work-view.db-sniffer.state.1.detail=The application has already fulfilled its initial purpose of exporting to Hibernate XML mapping files, but due to its architecture and the ease of adding new databases and export options, it is not ruled out that these may be added in the future.

work-view.fee.features.3=Flexibility
work-view.fee.features.4=Smart compilation

work-view.fee.description.1=fee is a fast and flexible library for evaluating mathematical expressions from strings. It focuses on runtime performance while keeping the parsing layer simple and efficient. This crate was originally designed to power scientific and engineering software where expressions cannot be hardcoded.
work-view.fee.description.2=One of the goals of this library is provide a simple but powerful API. To archive this, the Expr::compile() method, depending on the context provided and thanks to Rust’s type system, automatically picks the best Expr<T> for your Context. You only need to choose the right resolvers, and fee will compile to the most efficient form at compile time.
work-view.fee.description.3=To ensure product quality, benchmarks are executed with every change to guarantee maximum performance. These benchmarks can be found on the crate's page.
